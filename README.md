## What is `reg-actions`

This repository provides a `GitHub Action` for visual regression testing.   
(See also related projects [reg-suit](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-suit) and [reg-cli](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-cli)).   

This action uploads images and report as workflow artifact.   
The report is commented to PR and workflow summary by downloading and comparing the artifacts from the branch where the pull request will be merged.   
   
So, this action does *not* take screenshot, please generate images by your self.   
If you use `storybook`, we recommend using [storycap](https://github.com/reg-viz/storycap)   

### PR Comment

## How to use

### Minimal setup

Let's start with a minimal workflow setup.    
Please add `on: [push, pull_request]` to make it work correctly.   
The `github-token` is required to download and upload artifacts.

``` yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: reg-viz/reg-actions@v2
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          image-directory-path: "./images"
```

### Action inputs

Input definitions are written in [action.yml](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-actions/blob/main/dist/action.yml).

#### `github-token` (Required)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

GitHub API access token.
It is used to upload test report and add comment to pull request.

#### `image-directory-path` (Required)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

Path to images directory.The images stored in this directory will be compared with the expected images from the last upload.

#### `enable-antialias` (Optional)

- Type: Boolean
- Default: `false`

Enable antialias. If omitted false.

#### `matching-threshold` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

Matching threshold, ranges from 0 to 1. Smaller values make the comparison more sensitive. 0 by default.
Specifically, you can set how much of a difference in the YIQ difference metric should be considered a different pixel.
If there is a difference between pixels, it will be treated as "same pixel" if it is within this threshold.

#### `threshold-rate` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

The rate threshold at which the image is considered changed. When the difference ratio of the image is larger than the set rate detects the change. Applied after `matchingThreshold`. 0 by default.

#### `threshold-pixel` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

The pixel threshold at which the image is considered changed. When the difference pixel of the image is larger than the set pixel detects the change. This value takes precedence over `thresholdRate`. Applied after `matchingThreshold`. 0 by default.

#### `target-hash` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

The commit hash to be compared.   
For example you can determine the target hash dynamically using a [github script](https://github.com/actions/github-script).   
Please see [test_with_target_hash.yml](./.github/workflows/test_with_target_hash.yml).

#### `custom-report-page` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

The custom report page link.   

#### `report-file-path` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

Path of the generated report html file. This file can be deployed in other Actions steps, but is not included in the artifact. If omitted, no html report is generated.  

#### `artifact-name` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: `"reg"`

The name of the artifact to be Uploaded.
Default is "reg".

#### `branch` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: `"reg_actions"`

The branch name for uploading images. This action will upload the image to the specified branch and use its URL in the comments.
Default is "reg_actions".

#### `disable-branch` (Optional)

- Type: Boolean
- Default: `false`

The option to disable push to a branch. When set to false, the `branch` option is ignored, and images will not be displayed in the comments.

#### `comment-report-format` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: `"raw"`

The option how to render changed file in comment. This action will change PR and workflow summary report format. Available options are `raw` and `summarized`. `raw` will render report comment with expanded results. `summarized` will render report comment using `<details>` tag to summarize by changed files.

#### `outdated-comment-action` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: `"none"`

The option to handle outdated comments in the PR. Available options are `none` and `minimize`. `none` do nothing. `minimize` will minimize outdated action comments.

### `retention-days` (Optional)

- Type: number
- Default: `30`

This option allows you to specify the duration for which images are stored in the branch. If not specified, the default is 30 days.

## Limitation

- If the `artifact` is deleted, the report will also be deleted, see [`Artifact and log retention policy`](https://docs.github.com/ja/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy) for the retention period of the `artifact`.

## Troubleshooting

- `Error: HttpError: Resource not accessible by integration`.

Please go to the `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions` of the relevant repository and change the permission from `Read repository contents permission` to `Read and write permissions`.
