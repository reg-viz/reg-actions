## What is `reg-actions`

This repository provides a `GitHub Action` for visual regression testing.   
(See also related projects [reg-suit](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-suit) and [reg-cli](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-cli)).   

This action uploads images and report as workflow artifact.   
The html report is generated by downloading and comparing the artifacts from the branch where the pull request will be merged.   
If the action succeeds, you will see the following html report.   
Please check this [PR](https://github.com/bokuweb/reg-actions/pull/53) too.
   
So, this action does *not* take screenshot, please generate images by your self.   
If you use `storybook`, we recommend using [storycap](https://github.com/reg-viz/storycap)

## How to use

### Minimal setup

Let's start with a minimal workflow setup.    
Please add `on: [push, pull_request]` to make it work correctly.   
The `github-token` is required to download and upload artifacts.

``` yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: bokuweb/reg-actions@v1
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          image-directory-path: "./images"
```

### Action inputs

Input definitions are written in [action.yml](./action.yml).

#### `github-token` (Required)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

GitHub API access token.
It is used to upload test report and add comment to pull request.

#### `image-directory-path` (Required)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

Path to images directory.The images stored in this directory will be compared with the expected images from the last upload.

#### `enable-antialias` (Optional)

- Type: Boolean
- Default: `false`

Enable antialias. If omitted false.

#### `matching-threshold` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

Matching threshold, ranges from 0 to 1. Smaller values make the comparison more sensitive. 0 by default.
Specifically, you can set how much of a difference in the YIQ difference metric should be considered a different pixel.
If there is a difference between pixels, it will be treated as "same pixel" if it is within this threshold.

#### `threshold-rate` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

The rate threshold at which the image is considered changed. When the difference ratio of the image is larger than the set rate detects the change. Applied after `matchingThreshold`. 0 by default.

#### `threshold-pixel` (Optional)

- Type: Number
- Default: N/A

The pixel threshold at which the image is considered changed. When the difference pixel of the image is larger than the set pixel detects the change. This value takes precedence over `thresholdRate`. Applied after `matchingThreshold`. 0 by default.

#### `target-hash` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

The commit hash to be compared.   
For example you can determine the target hash dynamically using a [github script](https://github.com/actions/github-script).   
Please see [test_with_target_hash.yml](./.github/workflows/test_with_target_hash.yml).

#### `custom-report-page` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

The custom report page link.   

#### `report-file-path` (Optional)

- Type: String
- Default: N/A

Path of the generated report html file. This file can be deployed in other Actions steps, but is not included in the artifact. If omitted, no html report is generated.  

## Authorization

The `reg-actions` report is created as a `Github Oauth App` that requires the `repo` scope.    
This is because, the report app downloads artifact directly and it needs the `repo` scope to download the `artifact`.   

So if you use this action in private repository, please check [Restricting access to your organization's data](https://docs.github.com/ja/organizations/restricting-access-to-your-organizations-data).

## Limitation

- If the `artifact` is deleted, the report will also be deleted, see [`Artifact and log retention policy`](https://docs.github.com/ja/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy) for the retention period of the `artifact`.
- The report may be slow to display. This is due to the fact that the report is built while retrieving the artifacts via `ReadableStream`. If this is a problem, please use [reg-suit](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-suit).
